# NC-Games 

Welcome to [Table Top](https://exquisite-taiyaki-455ba5.netlify.app/) a board games review react app.

This is a continuation of the solo nc-games backend project where I have designed and implemented the front end that utilises the endpoints I set up in the back end project.

To start off this project I did some research into other review sites and got a grasp of some of the key features this for of website needed and also I looked at some of the stylistic choices made that lean towards this genre of game. This helped me design some wire frames and mock ups for how I wanted to make Table Top.

Following on from the designs I sat down and identified components and planned put the app tree, where I planned components, state and context.
